Entropy = 7.969834 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 5000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 5000 samples is 209.29, and randomly
would exceed this value 98.34 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 126.7858 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.150060024 (error 0.27 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.016754 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
